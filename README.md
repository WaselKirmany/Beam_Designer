# Beam_Designer
Java project to design efficient mechanical beams

1. Input Type of beam, Shape of beam, Dimensions, type of load, amount of max. load, point of application of load, yield strength of material and factor of safety.
2. Calculates whether the beam might fail in the condition.
3. If it fails, suggest renovations to be made.

Types of Beam-
1. Cantilever
2. Simply Supported

Shape of Beam-
1. Rectangular
2. I beam
3. Circular

Type of load-
1. Point load
2. Uniform load
3. Distributed

Failure Theories-
1. Maximum Normal Stress
2. Maximum Shear Stress
